## Abstract
In this project, I wrote a program to simulate a set of flash cards through the command line! A user will be able to see the questions, take guesses, and see a final score at the end of the round.

The goal of this project was to develop good habits of TDD. The focus was writing tests for my code before implementing the functionality.

## Technologies

  - eslint
  - Mocha

## Install + Setup

Clone down the forked repo and cd into the ```test``` directory of the project in the command line.

From here run ```npm test```.

a series of all passed tests for this project will be displayed with a larger space at the bottom indicating the game is ready to be played. 

Press ```return``` directly in the command line to launch the

 ## Wins
	- Using the find() method in the Round class was quite the experiment. I'm not sure it was the cleanest method to use, but I wanted to puth the method into practice as it is new to my learning.
	- For a first at-bat with writing tests using chai and the ```expect assertion library```, I'd say this was a win. By no means is my testing flawless, but I'm proud of the insight I gained in the process.
  
  ## Challenges + Improvements
	- Because I used the find() method, the end of the game does not print my final percentage or questions I got correct. I tried to debug this a little but, but ran out of time.
